# Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

This is a static website project focused on life, death, current events, spiritual insights, and the Gospel. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and aims to guide visitors from curiosity about global events to deeper reflections on meaning, leading to Gospel messages for non-believers and end-times theology for Christians.

## Audience

1. **Non-believers**: Engage through current events analysis and thought-provoking content, guiding them to ponder life, death, and the Gospel.
2. **Christians**: Help deepen understanding of spiritual symbolism and encourage reflection on Scriptures.

## Technology Stack

- **Static Website**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Charts**: Chart.js or D3.js for interactive visualizations
- **Content Integrations**:
  - Notion for articles and reflections (as reference links)
  - Pcloud for video content hosting

## Development Guidelines

### General Rules

1. **No Backend**: This is a pure static website. Do not introduce server-side code, databases, or backend frameworks.
2. **File Preservation**: When making changes, create new versions or add-on features rather than overwriting existing files unless explicitly required.
3. **Documentation**: Log all significant changes in `conversation-log.md` to maintain project history.
4. **Language**: Content is primarily in Chinese (Cantonese and Mandarin). Preserve existing language and character encoding.

### Code Style

1. Keep HTML, CSS, and JavaScript clean and well-organized.
2. Use semantic HTML5 elements where appropriate.
3. Ensure all pages are responsive and accessible.
4. Avoid introducing complex build tools or dependencies that would complicate the static nature of the site.

### Navigation & User Flow

- Homepage should briefly introduce the site's purpose and key themes
- Subpages should cover:
  - Current events and analysis
  - Spiritual insights and symbolism
  - Gospel-centered hope and reflections
- Navigation should be intuitive and guide users progressively through content

### Content Guidelines

1. Use clear, accessible language that doesn't alienate the audience.
2. Avoid antagonistic or overly subjective language.
3. Focus on gradual progression to help understanding.
4. Respect the spiritual and sensitive nature of the content.

## Testing & Validation

Since this is a static website:
- Test pages by opening HTML files in a browser
- Verify all links work correctly
- Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- Ensure JavaScript interactions work as expected
- Validate that external integrations (Notion, Pcloud) load properly

## Project Files

- `project-instructions.md`: Detailed project guidelines
- `conversation-log.md`: Historical context and decisions
- `README.md`: Project overview and links
- `*.html`: Website pages
- `data.txt`: Data file for charts/statistics

## Important Notes

- Always review `project-instructions.md` and `conversation-log.md` before making changes
- Preserve the owner's original vision and content
- Maintain continuity with existing design and structure
- When in doubt, create new files rather than modifying critical existing ones
