### Entry 3 (2026-02-03) - Phase 2: Soul Injection & System Assessment

**Current System Rating:**
- **Architecture (8/10):** The "Funnel" logic (Index -> Monitor -> Timeline) is technically established. The file structure is cleaner after archiving old files.
- **User Experience (7/10):** The gamification (Click to Awaken -> Light Candles to Upgrade) effectively combats "passive scrolling," forcing interaction.
- **Spiritual Impact (4/10):** Currently, it serves as a "Cold Warning System". It successfully delivers "Shock" and "Facts," but lacks the critical "Love" component necessary to heal the "Frontal Lobe Damage" (loss of reasoning/empathy) discussed. It risks inducing fear without offering a cure.

**Discussion & Actions:**
1.  **Diagnosis:** We identified that the target audience suffers from formatted thinking and reduced analytical ability due to recent global events. A direct information dump is ineffective.
2.  **Action Taken (The Protocol):**
    - **Cleanup:** Moved legacy files to `_archive_2026` to reduce noise.
    - **Logic (`js/progression.js`):** Implemented a state machine. Users start as "Sleepers," awaken to become "Watchers" (Monitor), and must demonstrate empathy (lighting candles) to become "Seekers" (Timeline).
    - **The Funnel:**
        - `index.html`: The Filter. A binary choice between sleep and awakening.
        - `monitor.html`: The Reality. Requires active participation (lighting candles) to unlock deeper truth.
        - `timeline.html`: The Truth. Now gated behind the empathy check.
3.  **Strategic Gap:** The system currently leads users to the "End Times Truth" but lacks a "Sanctuary." We agreed that without a final stage emphasizing **God's Love** and **Restoration**, the project remains incomplete.
4.  **Next Focus:** "Phase 2: Soul Injection" - Developing "Level 3: The Sanctuary" and enriching the data with micro-narratives to foster genuine empathy.
