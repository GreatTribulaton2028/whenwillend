## Entries

### Entry 1 (2026-01-31)

- Initial discussion about the goal of the website: a platform focusing on life and death news records, linking current events, the seven-year tribulation, the Bible, the gospel, and other information.

- Purpose: Guide visitors from no interest to curiosity, awareness of news, disasters, wars, economic changes, and then to questions about life, death, afterlife, and ultimately lead them to consider the gospel. For believers, encourage further thought on end times.

### Entry 2 (2026-01-31)

- Added `tasks.html` as a standalone mission checklist page (末世 × 高科技風)，列出需求：保持原稿與傳福音問答風格不變，提供繁/簡/英切換，使用現有 PCloud 影片連結，註明圖片上傳尚未實作。

- Request: Open a dedicated page to record conversations for future AI or human reference.
