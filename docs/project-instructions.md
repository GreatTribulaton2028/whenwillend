# Project Instructions

## Goal
This project aims to build a website centered on life, death, current events, spiritual insights, and the Gospel. The purpose is to gently guide visitors, step by step, from an initial curiosity about global events to reflecting on deeper questions of meaning, leading non-believers to hear the Gospel and prompting Christians to rethink end-times theology.

## Audience
1. **Non-believers**: Engage them through analysis of current events, statistical insights, and thought-provoking stories. Guide them to ponder life, death, and beyond, ending with an introduction to the Gospel message.
2. **Christians**: Help unlock deeper understanding of spiritual symbolism, such as analyzing Revelation (e.g., topics like 'Toxon' and the first white horse), and encourage them to think in terms of the spirit of the Scriptures.

## Technology Stack
1. **Static Website**: Hosted on GitHub Pages.
    - Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. **Integrations**:
    - **Notion**: Articles and reflections to be used as reference links or embedded pages.
    - **Pcloud**: Hosting and embedding video content.
3. **Dynamic Features**:
    - Interactive charts and statistics using Chart.js or D3.js.

## Development Guidelines
1. All progress and major decisions should be logged in `conversation-log.md` to ensure continuity and traceability.
2. Subsequent developers or AI agents should reference this document and the conversation log to understand the project’s history and goals.
3. Navigation and user flow should be intuitive:
    - **Homepage**: Briefly introduce the purpose of the site and key themes.
    - **Subpages**:
        - Current events and analysis.
        - Spiritual insights and symbolism.
        - Closing with Gospel-centered hope and reflections.
4. Avoid introducing subjective or antagonistic language that could alienate the audience.
5. Focus on clarity, accessibility, and gradual progression in content to facilitate understanding.

## Instructions for AI
To continue or contribute to this project, follow these steps:
- Review `project-instructions.md` for an overview of the project’s goals, audience, and guidelines.
- Check `conversation-log.md` for historical context and ongoing discussions.
- Build upon the existing website structure in a way that does not overwrite the owner's original files. Instead, create new versions or add-on features without altering prior contributions.
- Maintain a log of changes and reasons for updates in conversation logs.
